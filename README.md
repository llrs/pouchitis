The goal of pouchitis is to integrate the data from the published paper of "[Associations between host gene expression, the mucosal microbiome, and clinical outcome in the pelvic pouch of patients with inflammatory bowel disease](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0637-x)" for the article: [Multi-omic modelling of inflammatory bowel disease with regularized canonical correlation analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20031492)
